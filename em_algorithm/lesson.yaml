  Type: Standard
  Organization: JHU DSL + JHU Biostats
  Version: 2.3.1

- Class: text
  Output: "Welcome to the swirl lesson on the EM algorithm. This lesson is going to give you some practice on 
  working with the EM algorithm. The goal is to teach you a little about the algorithm and to show you at least one 
  non-standard example. We are going to start with the most common example you see in classes."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's start by setting the seed. Use the set.seed() function and set the seed to 1234
  CorrectAnswer: set.seed(1234)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='set.seed(1234)')
  Hint: Hint - try set.seed(1234)


- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now let's simulate some data that we will use to try out our example.  Generate a mean vector of length 500 with 250 0s and 250 3s. This will be our mean vector. Call it mu.
  CorrectAnswer: "mu = rep(c(0,3),each=250)"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='mu = rep(c(0,3),each=250)')
  Hint: Hint - try typing mu <- rep(c(0,3),each=250)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Using that mean vector create a vector of normal data with those means called y. 
  CorrectAnswer: "y = rnorm(500,mean=mu)"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='y = rnorm(500,mean=mu)')
  Hint: Hint - try typing y = rnorm(500,mean=mu)
  
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now make a density plot to see if the distribution looks bimodal
  CorrectAnswer: "plot(density(y))"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='plot(density(y))')
  Hint: Hint - try typing plot(density(y))

- Class: figure
  Output: "Now read a little about the EM algorithm for this case in the Rstudio viewer or in the browser and then return here. If you are in Rstudio you probably have to click on the viewer tab."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Initialize your parameters with some guesses. Set mu1 to be one
  CorrectAnswer: "mu1=1"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='mu1=1')
  Hint: Hint - try typing mu1=1
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Initialize your parameters with some guesses. Set mu2 to be seven
  CorrectAnswer: "mu2=7"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='mu2=7')
  Hint: Hint - try typing mu2=7
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Initialize your parameters with some guesses. Set alpha to be 0.75
  CorrectAnswer: "alpha=0.75"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='alpha=0.75')
  Hint: Hint - try typing alpha=0.75
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now we are going to do the E-step. Recall that we need to replace z with its expected value. Define a variable z and use dnorm to calculate the expected value.
  CorrectAnswer: "z = (dnorm(y,mean=mu1)*alpha)/(dnorm(y,mean=mu1)*alpha + (dnorm(y,mean=mu2)*(1-alpha)))"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='z = (dnorm(y,mean=mu1)*alpha)/(dnorm(y,mean=mu1)*alpha + (dnorm(y,mean=mu2)*(1-alpha)))')
  Hint: Hint - try typing z = (dnorm(y,mean=mu1)*alpha)/(dnorm(y,mean=mu1)*alpha + (dnorm(y,mean=mu2)*(1-alpha)))
 
 
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Plot y versus z and observe where the probability switches between one normal and the other. 
  CorrectAnswer: "plot(y,z)"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='plot(y,z)')
  Hint: Hint - try typing plot(y,z)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now use the formulae to get new estimates for mu1,mu2, and alpha. If you need help look in the Viewer/webpage with the EM algorithm description. Start with mu1 
  CorrectAnswer: "mu1 = sum(z*y)/sum(z)"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='mu1 = sum(z*y)/sum(z)')
  Hint: Hint - try typing mu1 = sum(z*y)/sum(z)


- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now mu2
  CorrectAnswer: "mu2 = sum((1-z)*y)/sum((1-z))"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='mu2 = sum((1-z)*y)/sum((1-z))')
  Hint: Hint - try typing mu2 = sum((1-z)*y)/sum((1-z))

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now alpha
  CorrectAnswer: "alpha = mean(z)"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='alpha = mean(z)')
  Hint: Hint - try typing alpha = mean(z)


- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Look at the values of mu1, mu2, and alpha and see if they are close to the right values
  CorrectAnswer: "c(mu1,mu2,alpha)"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='c(mu1,mu2,alpha)')
  Hint: Hint - try typing c(mu1,mu2,alpha)



- Class: figure
  Output: "If I iterate a large number of times here is what I get"
  Figure: em-end.R
  FigureType: new


- Class: text
  Output: "You can see that all the parameters converged. But if I instead make the means very close to each other, say instead of 0 and 3 I use 0 and 0.05 this happens"

- Class: figure
  Output: "If I iterate a large number of times here is what I get"
  Figure: em-end-close.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: text
  Output: "In this case the likelihood surface was very flat even though we introduced the z_i indicator and so the em algorithm converges to a local minimum."

- Class: text
  Output: "Now let's consider a slightly more complicated example from genetics."


- Class: figure

  the browser and then return here."
